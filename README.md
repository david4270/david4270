### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **David**, and welcome to my GitHub page! 

I am a UofT Engineering Alumni (ECE 2T2+PEY) who loves to explore different things.

During the Engineering Program, I took some challenging but exciting courses, such as:
- Operating Systems
- Computer Hardware
- Computer Networks
- Computer Architecture
- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Computer Security

Here are some fun facts about myself:
- I love to review things and have a review Instagram page! Check @davids_review on Instagram!
- I used to play drums and guitar.
- I love travelling - once I travelled to Montreal myself in winter.
- I am following Tottenham Hotspur (or "Spurs"), and visiting the new stadium is on my bucket list.
